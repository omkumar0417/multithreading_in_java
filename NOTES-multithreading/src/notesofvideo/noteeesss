NOTES OF MULTITHREADING

CPU
The CPU, often referred to as the brain of the computer, 
is responsible for executing instructions from programs. 
It performs basic arithmetic, logic, control, and 
input/output operations specified by the instructions.


Core
A core is an individual processing unit within a CPU. 
Modern CPUs can have multiple cores, allowing them 
to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

A quad-core processor has four cores, allowing it 
to perform four tasks simultaneously. For instance, one 
core could handle your web browser, another your music player, 
another a download manager, and another a background system update.


Program
A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that 
tells the computer how to perform a specific task

Microsoft Word is a program that allows users to create and edit documents.


Process
A process is an instance of a program that is being executed. 
When a program runs, the operating system creates 
a process to manage its execution.
When we open Microsoft Word, it becomes a process 
in the operating system.



Thread
A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. 
A process can have multiple threads, which share the 
same resources but can run independently.

A web browser like Google Chrome might use multiple 
threads for different tabs, with each tab running as a separate thread.
